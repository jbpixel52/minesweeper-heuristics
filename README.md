# minesweeper-heuristics
 
This implementation includes the MinesweeperGame class, which handles the game logic, board creation, mine placement, user interaction, and integration with the MinesweeperSolver class for applying the heuristic solver.

You can customize the game settings by adjusting the size and minesCount parameters when creating a new MinesweeperGame instance.
